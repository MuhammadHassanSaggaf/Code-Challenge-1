# Code-Challenge-1

Welcome to Week 1 JavaScript challenge! of Moringa School!
In this repo you’ll find three folders, each containing a single JS file with a function that:

1. **chaiCalculator/chai.js** – Calculates ingredients for Kenyan chai.
2. **bodaFareCalculator/fare.js** – Estimates boda boda ride fare.
3. **mobileMoneyEstimator/fee.js** – Computes simplified mobile‐money transaction fees.

Each script uses `prompt()` for input and logs a clear, formatted result to the console.
